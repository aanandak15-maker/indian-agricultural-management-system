# 🗺️ QGIS Integration for Indian Agricultural Mapping

## Overview
This setup integrates QGIS (desktop GIS) with your React web application for maximum accuracy in Indian agricultural mapping. QGIS handles data preparation and analysis, while Leaflet provides web rendering.

## 🎯 Why QGIS + Leaflet is the Best Free Solution

### **QGIS Advantages for India:**
- **Free & Open-Source** - GPL licensed, no API limits
- **Superior Indian Data Support** - Bhuvan ISRO, IMD, NRSC integration
- **Professional Analysis Tools** - Soil analysis, yield estimation, field digitization
- **Offline Capability** - Perfect for rural areas with poor connectivity
- **Community Plugins** - Indian-specific features and datasets

### **Hybrid Architecture:**
- **QGIS Backend** - Data preparation, analysis, validation
- **Leaflet Frontend** - Web rendering, user interaction
- **Supabase Database** - Data storage and real-time sync

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Install QGIS
```bash
# Download from https://qgis.org/
# Version 3.36+ recommended for latest features
```

### 2. Install Required Plugins
- **QuickMapServices** - Indian basemaps (Bhuvan, OSM India)
- **QGIS2Web** - Export to Leaflet/HTML
- **Profile Tool** - Elevation analysis
- **Zonal Statistics** - Field area calculations

### 3. Configure Indian Data Sources
- **Bhuvan ISRO** - Satellite imagery and crop monitoring
- **IMD Weather** - Rainfall and temperature data
- **NRSC** - Topographic maps and land use
- **ICAR** - Agricultural research data

## 🔧 Integration Workflow

### Data Preparation (QGIS)
1. Import Indian agricultural datasets
2. Digitize field boundaries with high precision
3. Run spatial analysis (area, slope, soil type)
4. Export as GeoJSON for web use

### Web Integration (React + Leaflet)
1. Load QGIS-exported data in Supabase
2. Display in Leaflet with QGIS-enhanced layers
3. Enable real-time editing and updates
4. Provide offline tile caching

## 🚀 Benefits for Your Agricultural System

- **Professional Accuracy** - Desktop GIS precision in web app
- **Indian-Optimized** - Local datasets and compliance
- **Cost-Free** - No API keys or usage limits
- **Scalable** - Handles large agricultural datasets
- **Offline Ready** - Works in rural areas
